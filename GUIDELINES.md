## Maintainability

- **Code must be MAINTAINABLE.** Prefer clear, simple structure over quick fixes.
- **No spiraling.** Do not patch repeatedly in a quick-and-dirty way; step back and fix properly or leave a clear TODO.
- **Keep it clean, keep it simple.** When in doubt, remove complexity.
- **Ask.** If the right approach is unclear, ask instead of trying many code patches that produce unmaintainable code.
