# Project Guidelines

Follow these in addition to HANDOFF.md.

## CRITICAL: Who does things

- **Never ask the user to do stuff.** Do not say "run X", "restart the backend", "you can try Y".
- **Ask if I can do it.** When something could be run or done, ask: **"Want me to do it?"** or **"Should I run it?"** — the agent runs; the user does not get instructions to run things.

---

## Maintainability

- **Code must be MAINTAINABLE.** Prefer clear, simple structure over quick fixes.
- **No spiraling.** Do not patch repeatedly in a quick-and-dirty way; step back and fix properly or leave a clear TODO.
- **Keep it clean, keep it simple.** When in doubt, remove complexity.
- **Ask.** If the right approach is unclear, ask instead of trying many code patches that produce unmaintainable code.
